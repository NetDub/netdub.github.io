      <description>In the simplest sense, NetDUB is about spending a bit of time each quarter, socialising with your fellow Networking professionals.
To be more complex about it, the plan behind NetMcr was to fill a void in Dublin&amp;rsquo;s social calendar. Whilst the majority of &amp;lsquo;meetings&amp;rsquo; in the city centre on development, we&amp;rsquo;re focusing specifically on Network Engineers, Architects, Technicians, or perhaps just anyone interested in the profession.
The NetDUB events are currently being bootstrapped, and currently looking for a reoccuring venue.</description>
